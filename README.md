Slot tips for the newbie to "gaming" (including myself)

* Only spend what you are willing to lose
* 3-5 pulls per machine type
	* Once per every machine
	* 3 pulls if you have 20-50$, 5 pulls if you have 50$ or above
	* Once you get the "taste", or small inital payout from that machine to entice people, you will want go to another machine as well.
* 1 cent to 25 cent denominations recommended... 
* You don't have to bet max to get max payback on video slots
	* So try betting 1-25 credits on "penny slots" if possible, and try to bet 2-6 credits on "quarter slots" if possible.
* Better of betting more if it has a mystery bonus, however
	* Because it's triggered by the amount of coins waigered on the game/bank of games.
	* When you are play on mystery you are not betting money on the spins.
* If amount of bets and payouts visible, prefer more bets over payouts.
	* Note that even if the machines look alike, they can have different payout rates.
		* So the outcome can really make a difference
* Winning (loose) machines often found in highly visible areas.
	* So it is recommended to pick a highly visible machine
	* Not in a crowded area however.
* Try to avoid progressive slots if...
	* You don't want to lose all your money as fast
	* You prefer having fun
* Use progressive slots only if...
	* You really want a .000015 chance of getting rich (or so...)
* Try betting with machines with bonus features
	* Unless it's too expensive and you have like 20$
