# OpenSlotTips v2
Slot tips for the newbie to "gaming" (including myself), based off of Professor Slots' tips.

* ***Only spend what you are willing to lose***
* ***3 pulls, 1 cent, 1-25 credits*** recommended... 
	* ***Once per every machine type***
	* ***Once you get the "taste"***, or small initial payout from that machine to entice people, you will want ***go to another type of machine*** as well.
	* Note that ***even if the machines look alike, they can have different payout rates.***
  * To calculate the amount you are going to spend: `CREDITS*SLOT_WORTH=SLOT_SPEND`
* You ***don't have to bet max to get max payback on video slots***
	* So ***try betting as little as possible.***
* If amount of bets and payouts visible, ***prefer more bets over payouts.***
* Winning (loose) machines *often* found in highly visible areas, but *not always.*
	* So try to pick a ***highly visible machine***
	* ***Not in a crowded area*** however.
* Try to ***avoid progressive slots.***
  * These are ***slots that, as people put money in, the jackpot grows until someone gets the jackpot***; then it starts over.
* Try betting with machines with ***bonus features, unless it's too expensive.***
* Note that ***cruise ship casinos have almost 0 regulation.***
	* So nothing is necessarily a thing on said casinos.
* If it's been more than 3 hours: try once more. If you win: try every 3 hours.
* Most if not youtubers who claim to be "casino techs" or something of the like are most likely scam artists.
	* If theu ARE a tech, they are likely breaking a NDA, which they really shouldn't want to do.
