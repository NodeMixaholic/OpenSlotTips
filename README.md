Slot tips for the newbie to "gaming"

* 3-5 pulls per machine type
	* Once per every machine
	* 3 pulls if you have 20-50$, 5 pulls if you have 50$ or above
* 1 cent to 25 cent denominations
* You don't have to bet max to get max payback on video slots
	* So bet 1-25 cents on "penny slots" if possible.
* Better of betting more if it has a mystery bonus, however
	* Because it's triggered by the amount of coins waigered on the game/bank of games
	* When you are play on mystery you are not betting money on the spins.
* If amount of bets and payouts visible, prefer more bets over payouts.
	* Note that even if the machines look alike, they can have different payout rates.
		* So the outcome can really make a difference
* Winning (loose) machines often found in highly visible areas.
	* So it is recommended to pick a highly visible machine
	* Not in a crowded area however.

	* You don't want to lose all your money
	* You prefer having fun
* Use progressive slots only if...
	* You really want a .000015 chance of getting rich
* Try betting with machines with bonus features
	* Unless it's too expensive and you have like 20$
